 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.984   TIME= 15:34:44
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      10.141   TIME= 15:34:45
 Material number 21 (used by element 678573) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      41.125   TIME= 15:35:41
 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 out-of-core memory mode.  This memory mode may provide significantly    
 worse performance compared to the in-core memory mode, depending on     
 the amount of available system memory and I/O speed.  Please monitor    
 the solver performance to ensure that the large amount of I/O to the    
 solver files does not create a bottleneck for performance.              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      88.062   TIME= 15:39:00
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 230%.      
 This often indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or a particularly slow hard       
 drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run faster on  
 identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive             
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 Mechanical APDL Performance Guide which is part of the Ansys Help       
 system.
