 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).

 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 49%.  This 
 often indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required to      
 efficiently handle this simulation or a particularly slow hard drive    
 configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run faster on        
 identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive             
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the
