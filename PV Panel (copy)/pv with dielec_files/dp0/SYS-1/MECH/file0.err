 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.484   TIME= 11:54:51
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       5.047   TIME= 11:54:51
 Material number 19 (used by element 233655) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      91.750   TIME= 11:56:49
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 40%.  This 
 often indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required to      
 efficiently handle this simulation or a particularly slow hard drive    
 configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run faster on        
 identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive             
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 Mechanical APDL Performance Guide which is part of the Ansys Help       
 system.
