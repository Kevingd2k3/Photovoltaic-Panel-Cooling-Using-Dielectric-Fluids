 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to

 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 158%.      
 This often indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or a particularly slow hard       
 drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run faster on  
 identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive             
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 Mechanical APDL Performance Guide which is part of the Ansys Help       
 system.
