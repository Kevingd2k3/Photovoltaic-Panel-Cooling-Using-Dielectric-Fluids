 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.188   TIME= 19:21:11
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.891   TIME= 19:21:13
 Material number 49 (used by element 730055) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     206.203   TIME= 19:29:33
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 158%.      
 This often indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or a particularly slow hard       
 drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run faster on  
 identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive             
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 Mechanical APDL Performance Guide which is part of the Ansys Help       
 system.
