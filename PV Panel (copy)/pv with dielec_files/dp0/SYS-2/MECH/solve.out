 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 18 and contact element type 17 has been set up.  The       
 companion pair has real constant set ID 17.  Both pairs should have     
 the same behavior.                                                      
 MAPDL will deactivate the current pair and keep its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.                                        
 Pure thermal contact is activated.
 The emissivity is defined through the material property.
 Thermal convection coefficient, environment temperature, and
  heat flux are defined using the SFE command.
 Target temperature is used for convection/radiation calculation
  for near field contact.
 Small sliding logic is assumed
