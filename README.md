# Photovoltaic-Panel-Cooling-Using-Dielectric-Fluids
The core objective of the project was to shift the cost from machining highly intricate aluminium / copper blocks with cooling jackets, heat pipes and heat sinks using full immersion cooling techniques with the aid of dielectric fluids, increase the efficiency of solar panel by 16.7%. It is advised to use Ansys R2025 for best results.
